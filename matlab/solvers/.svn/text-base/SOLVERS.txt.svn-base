The main solvers in this directory take up to 3 inputs:
a matrix,
a vector,
and options.

If the vector is omitted, they return a function that
solves systems of equations in the matrix.

So far, options is used to set up options for pcg based methods.  
It has two default fields: tol and maxit.

The best way to solve systems in singular laplacian matrices, is
to wrap them in another solver, using lapWrapSolver.

For more information (and examples) look at doc/solvers.txt

The routines that work so far are:
cgSolver
amdSolver
cmgSolver (if you have Yiannis Koutis's code)
iccSolver
lupSolver

Others that should be made to work are:
ldlSolve
ldlSolveF


routines that should be eliminated are
lapBackSolveF
lapBackSolve
lapBackSolve2
