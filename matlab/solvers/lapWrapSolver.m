% takes a solver for pos def systems,
% and uses it to construct a solver for a laplacian system
% by fixing last entry
%
% if only solvername is supplied, this creates a wrapped version of
% that solver.  But, it can only be applied to a matrix.
%
% if the solver takes options, it can supply those too
%
% Examples:
%  a = grid2(10); 
%  la = lap(a);
%  b = randn(length(la),1); b = b - mean(b);
%  x = lapWrapSolver('iccSolver',la,b); norm(la*x-b)
%  f = lapWrapSolver('iccSolver',la); norm(la*f(b)-b)
%  g = lapWrapSolver('iccSolver'); f = g(la); norm(la*f(b)-b)
