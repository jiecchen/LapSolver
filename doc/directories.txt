This describes the directory structure, and its logic.
When you create a new directory, type "svn add dirname"
so that it will be added into the subversion repository.

Directories:

  .    : This is the base directory.  Keep it as clean as possible.
         Only put readmes and initialization code.

  doc : documentation / instructions on how to use code

  data : data that has or can be used to extract matrices
	 
  java : for java code
    It has one subdirectory right now called "yins".
    we should probably change that to something like lapsolve, or the
    name of our project.

  matlab : for matlab code
    solvers : for solving systems of equations
    generators : generate systems of equations
    sparsify : for code to sparsify matrices, and test approximation
       quality
    cut : code to cut graphs
    util : various utility routines in matlab

  flow : C++ implementation of flow algorithm (Kelner et al.)
