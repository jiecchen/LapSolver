Here are two examples of how to use the solvers.

First, for a positive definite matrix:

a = randn(6); a = a * a';
b = randn(6,1);
x = amdSolver(a,b); % get the solution to the linear system
norm(a*x-b)

f = amdSolver(a); % get a function that solves systems in a
norm(a*f(b)-b)


To solve a Laplacian system, it is easiest to do it by reducing it
to a positive definite system.  Assuming that the underlying graph is
connected, the following will work:

a = rand(6); a = a + a'; a = a - diag(diag(a));
la = lap(a);
b = randn(6,1); b = b - mean(b);
x = lapWrapSolver('amdSolver',la,b);
norm(la*x-b)

Or, to get a function, try

f = lapWrapSolver('amdSolver',la);
norm(la*f(b)-b)
