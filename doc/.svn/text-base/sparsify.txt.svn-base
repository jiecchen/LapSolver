Here is an example of how to use the sparsify code:

1. Generate a Laplacian matrix:

n = 5000;
a = del3Graph(n);
la = lap(a);

2. Sparsify it, and check that it is in fact sparser.

>> lb = reffSparse(la,10); % warning: 10 here is very agressive.  Better to leave this blank.
>> [nnz(la)/n, nnz(lb)/n]

ans =

   16.2464   10.9612

3. Now, check the relative condition number.  
To do this, we set up a solver for each matrix, and then use the condition number estimating routine for positive definite matrices.

>> solvea = wrapLapSolver('iccSolver',la);
>> solveb = wrapLapSolver('iccSolver',lb);
>> condEstimate(la,lb,solvea,solveb)

ans =

    5.8469

4. Alternatively, you could turn these into positive definite matrices and then check the condition number.  In this case, you can use the default solver in condEstimate.

>> mod = sparse(n,n); mod(1,1) = 1;
>> condEstimate(la+mod,lb+mod)

ans =

    5.8469
